          <p class="mt-5 md:text-2xl text-sm text-center">Here you can continuously find the practical information about Fantasy Quest Esbjerg 2024. The quest is for the whole family, from 7 years and up, as the very young will not get the most out of the story - and then there are also a few sinister villains among the role players. You don't have to be dressed up, but you really want to be. The quest takes place on Saturday 14 September 2024 during Fantasy Festival.

          <p class="mt-5 md:text-2xl text-sm">
               
          ... that evil would come from the sea. Through generations that tale was passed on. 
          You heard it when Esbjerg was founded in 1868. You always kept an eye on the sea. To the west.</p>
         
          <p class="mt-5 md:text-2xl text-sm">So in Esbjerg they built a defense against evil. Something that would keep an eye on the sea, something that would step in if things went wrong.</p>
          
          <p class="mt-5 md:text-2xl text-sm">In 1995, that protection was reinforced when the sculptures "Man by the sea" were created. While the artist built during the day, the sorcerer Gygaz the Wise worked at night. Gygaz opened a portal to the world of fighters. Here he found four good fighters who volunteered.</p>

           <p class="mt-5 md:text-2xl text-sm">They said goodbye to their families and trotted through the portal towards Esbjerg. Here they met with Gygaz. The air trembled with magic, and as the last words of a powerful form left Gygaz's lips, the four giants had become one with the statues of the four white men. That way they could keep an eye on the sea forever...</p>

        <div>
          <p class="text-center md:text-2xl text-sm pb-5">...But then mysterious things began to happen. Nature became ill. The ancients spoke of evil. About the guardians. One day the clouds drew together, over the sea to the west, and it became unnaturally dark. Lightning tore the sky. A large, winged creature could be seen in the sky.</p>

          <p class="text-center md:text-2xl text-sm pb-5">The four statues stood up, the guardians had been awakened, they got ready and shouted. The cries could be heard across the land, across portals to other worlds. "We need heroes in Esbjerg!", they shouted.</p>
    
          <p class="text-center md:text-2xl text-sm pb-5">It's time for the heroes to gather. It is time for evil to be fought. It is time for the portals to close. It's time for Fantasy Quest Esbjerg. Are you ready?</p>
