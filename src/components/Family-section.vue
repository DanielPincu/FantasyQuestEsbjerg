It's about living into another world, a magical story, where you are on a "quest" together - a mission, a task, a hunt.</p>

        <p class="pb-5 md:text-3xl">Here you meet magical creatures who set you some tasks and challenges along the way towards the goal, which you must solve together to complete the Quest. </p>

         <p class="pb-5 md:text-3xl">The degree of difficulty has been lowered so that the children can help solve the tasks. But make no mistake, all good strength and cooperation skills are needed if you are to help save Esbjerg.</p>

         <p class="md:text-3xl">As an added bonus, you can meet the YouTuber Salmon Rider during the Quest around the streets of Esbjerg.</p>

        <p class="pb-5  md:text-3xl">The quest is for the whole family, from 7 years and up, as the very young will not get the most out of the story - and then there are also a few sinister villains among the role players.</p>

         <p class="pb-5  md:text-3xl">You don't have to be dressed up, but you really want to be.</p>

         <p class=" md:text-3xl">The quest takes place on Saturday 14 September 2024 during Fantasy Festival.</p>
